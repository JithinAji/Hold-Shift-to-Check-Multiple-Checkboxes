#Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes

A challenge done as part of [Javascript 30 days challenge by Wesbos](https://javascript30.com/). This is the 10th challenge from the series.

I recommend everyone to have a look at it and this is totally free. Try doing this [challenge](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/5feee4ef3a75762422aabd1d/view/194129765) without watching the video of wesbos doing it.

I just uploaded this inorder to showcase my javascript code in [function.js](./function.js) file. ALthough the logic which I came up with is unnecessarily complicated, atleast I tried and somehow this made me proud. I guess this is working as expected but I suspect there are some flaws which I will correct in the future. If someone is reading this you are welcome to try.
